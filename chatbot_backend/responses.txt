Oh no! Losing a library book can be stressful. According to our rules, if a book is not returned on the due date and is reported to have lost it, you'll have to pay for it after the prescribed limit of time. The amount payable to the library will be two times the actual price of the book, and this amount will not be refundable.
I understand that it can be frustrating. As a reminder, it's essential to comply with our hostel rules and conduct policy. Losing a library book can result in penalties, so it's crucial to be more responsible in the future. If you need any help or guidance, feel free to ask!
I think I understand what you're saying! "Buried" in Tamil is "புதைக்கபட்டது" (pudhaikkappattathu).
In the context of the library, "borrowed" means that you have taken a book from the library for a specific period, with the intention of returning it to the library.
In Tamil, "borrowed" means "கடன் வாங்கியது" (kaṭaṉ vāṅkiyatatu).
Let's calculate your SGPA for this semester!

Using the formula: SGPA = (P1*C1 + SP2*C2 + SP3*C3 + SP4*C4) / C

Where:
SP1 = 4.0, C1 = 3
SP2 = 3.3, C2 = 4
SP3 = 3.7, C3 = 2
SP4 = 2.7, C4 = 1

First, multiply the grade points by the credit hours:
(4.0*3) + (3.3*4) + (3.7*2) + (2.7*1)
= 12 + 13.2 + 7.4 + 2.7
= 35.3

Next, find the total credits attempted (C):
C = C1 + C2 + C3 + C4
= 3 + 4 + 2 + 1
= 10

Now, divide the sum by the total credits:
SGPA = 35.3 ÷ 10
≈ 3.53

So, your SGPA for this semester is approximately 3.53!
Let's calculate your CGPA!

Since you've completed two semesters, we'll calculate the CGPA as follows:

CGPA = (SGPA1*C1 + SGPA2*C2) / (C1 + C2)

Where:
SGPA1 = 2.5, C1 = 1 (assuming 1 semester)
SGPA2 = 3, C2 = 1 (assuming 1 semester)

First, multiply the grade points by the credit hours:
(2.5*1) + (3*1)
= 2.5 + 3
= 5.5

Next, find the total credits attempted (C):
C = C1 + C2
= 1 + 1
= 2

Now, divide the sum by the total credits:
CGPA = 5.5 ÷ 2
= 2.75

Your CGPA is approximately 2.75!

To calculate the GPA, you can use the following formula:

SGPA = (P1*C1 + P2*C2 + P3*C3 + P4*C4)/C

Where:

* P1, P2, P3, and P4 are the grade points earned in respective courses
* C1, C2, C3, and C4 are the credit hours of those courses studied in the semester
* C is the total number of credits attempted in the semester, which is the sum of C1, C2, C3, and C4

For example, let's say you have the following grades and credit hours in a semester:

* Course 1: Grade A (grade point 4), Credit hours 3
* Course 2: Grade B (grade point 3), Credit hours 2
* Course 3: Grade A (grade point 4), Credit hours 4
* Course 4: Grade C (grade point 2), Credit hours 1

To calculate the SGPA, you would use the following formula:

SGPA = (4*3 + 3*2 + 4*4 + 2*1)/10
SGPA = (12 + 6 + 16 + 2)/10
SGPA = 36/10
SGPA = 3.6

The CGPA is calculated as the weighted average for all semesters cumulatively using grade points of all the courses taken by a student.

Calculating the GPA can be a bit tricky, but don't worry, I'm here to guide you through it.

At PAF-IAST, the GPA (Grade Point Average) is calculated using a weighted average of the grades earned in each course. Here's a step-by-step guide to calculate your GPA:

1. **Identify the grades**: Collect the grades you've earned in each course, along with the credit hours for each course.
2. **Convert grades to grade points**: Use the following conversion table to convert your grades to grade points:
	* A: 4.00
	* B: 3.00
	* C: 2.00
	* D: 1.00
	* F: 0.00
3. **Calculate the total grade points**: Multiply the grade points for each course by the credit hours for that course. Add up the total grade points for all courses.
4. **Calculate the total credit hours**: Add up the total credit hours for all courses.
5. **Calculate the GPA**: Divide the total grade points by the total credit hours.

**Formula:** GPA = (Total Grade Points) / (Total Credit Hours)

**Example:**

Let's say you took three courses:

| Course | Grade | Credit Hours | Grade Points |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Course A | B | 3 | 3.00 x 3 = 9.00 |
| Course B | A | 2 | 4.00 x 2 = 8.00 |
| Course C | C | 4 | 2.00 x 4 = 8.00 |

**Total Grade Points:** 9.00 + 8.00 + 8.00 = 25.00
**Total Credit Hours:** 3 + 2 + 4 = 9

**GPA:** 25.00 / 9 = 2.78

So, your GPA would be 2.78.

Remember, PAF-IAST uses a minimum CGPA of 2.00 to remain in good academic standing. If you have any further questions or need help with calculating your GPA, feel free to ask!
