## - 2. Grading And Gpa Calculations


Grade Point Average
- The Grade Point Average (GPA) provides a continuous scale for grades earned. Two types of averages are computed for the grades obtained by a student, the Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA) and the Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA). SGPA indicates the GPA of courses completed in a semester, whereas CGPA reflects the GPA of all courses completed by a certain date  by a student.
- PAF-IAST follows Relative Grading system in its scheme of studies.

Interpretation of Grades

### - Grades are interpreted as follows:
- Grade Letter  -------  Grade Point  -------  Interpretation
- A   ---------------  4.0  ------------  exceptional
- A-  ---------------  3.67  -----------  Outstanding
- B+  ---------------  3.33  -----------  Excellent
- B   ---------------  3  --------------  Very Good
- B-  ---------------  2.67  -----------  Good
- C+  ---------------  2.33  -----------  Average
- C   ---------------  2.0  ------------  Satisfactory
- C-  ---------------  1.67  -----------  Low Pass
- D+  ---------------  1.33  -----------  Marginal Pass
- D   ---------------  1.0  ------------  Unsatisfactory
- F   ---------------  0.0  ------------  Fail
- Q   ----------------  -  -------------  Qualified
- W   ----------------  -  -------------  Withdrawn
- I   ----------------  -  -------------  Incomplete
- IP  ----------------  -  -------------  InProgress
- T   ----------------  -  -------------  Transfer

GPA Calculation

### - SGPA is calculated as follows:

## - Sgpa = (P1*C1 + P2*C2 + P3*C3 + P4*C4)/C

- > P1, P2, P3 and P4 are the grade points earned in respective courses,
- > while C1, C2, C3, C4 are the credit hours of those courses studied in the  semester.
- > C is the number of total credits attempted in the semester, that is, C=C1+C2+C3+C4.
- CGPA is calculated as the weighted average for all semesters cumulatively using grade points of all the courses taken by a student.
- In case of a course repetition, the grade of both the attempts are visible on the transcript but only the best grade is included in the cumulative grade point average (CGPA) calculations.
- The following letter-grades have no grade points, but they will appear on the transcript. However, they have no effect on the CGPA.
- a) "W" grade letter will be awarded for withdrawn courses. It will not be removed even if the student successfully completes that course subsequently.
- b) "Q" grade letter will be awarded on the completion of non-credit courses.
- c) "I" grade letter will be awarded, after approval of absence by the concerned BOF, if a student fails to appear in a final exam. (Refer 5.6 for I grade policy).
- d) "IP" grade letter is assigned by the system in FYP-I at the time of FYP-II enrolment or at the end of the semester (whichever is earlier).
- e) Letter "T" in the transcript grades column, indicates that the respective course credits have been approved and transferred to PAF-IAST.

## - 3. Transfer Policy

## - 10. Internship


Internship and its importance
- An internship is short-term on-job training or professional learning experience that offers meaningful, practical work related to a student's eld of study or career interest. Internships are offered by companies and organizations to provide entry-level exposure to
- students in a particular eld or industry. The major objective of the internship is to expose the students to a real-time work environment and assist them in developing professional skills such as teamwork, problem-solving, critical thinking, management, and
- communication. In this short-term training, students enhance their knowledge in a particular eld under the mentorship of skilled experts.


### The internship helps to develop the following skills:
- Professional behavior and knowledge of a specific industry/company, job functions such as marketing, customer service, accounting, design and production, application of theoretical knowledge into practical work
- Communication skills: interpersonal, teamwork, leadership, speaking, presenting, writing.
- Computer or technology skills with specific hardware and/or software
- Project-related skills: research, analysis, time management, multitask coordination, teamwork, project progress, and completion.
- Employment-enhancing activities: expanding the network of industry contacts, earning a job experience to reflect the performance.

Internship policy for BS Programs
- PAF-IAST approved 18 weeks (500 hours) of the internship/industrial training in the 2nd meeting of the academic council held on 11-062020. This includes 08 weeks summer semester internship (after the 6th semester) and 10 weeks total summer break internship (collectively after the 2nd and 4th semesters) which will be of 05 weeks in each summer break.

Allowed forms of Internship.
- Industrial training: An industrial training will be considered an internship experience through which students gain real-time work experience in an industry or R&D organization and gain knowledge through hands-on observation and job execution either in national or international/multinational companies.
- Project-based internship: A project-based internship is a learning process in which students bring acquired knowledge and methodological competencies into practice on some specific issue or problem in a national international/multinational company. This will be considered an internship experience if the student has completed the selected project or assignment which is to be assessed by the academic advisor (faculty member) and/or expert in the industry. The project could be based on developing a part of a new or existing product, preparing some specific strategy, or conducting analyses.
- Project:  The project with an industry or research institute can be regarded as an internship experience with the condition that students should demonstrate the application of knowledge and skills during the course/study program with quantitative conclusions or qualitative understanding as a result.
